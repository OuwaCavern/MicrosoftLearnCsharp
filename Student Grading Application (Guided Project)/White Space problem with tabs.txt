Notice that despite using a tab instead of a space character, some lines still don't have much whitespace between the student's name and their numeric score.

This difference is due to the way that tab spacing is applied. Tab stop locations are set at four-character intervals, and each tab will advance to the next tab stop location. If you have a string of five characters followed by a tab escape sequence, the escape sequence will advance to the tab stop at the eight-character location, filling the gap with space characters to create whitespace in the output. However, you can advance to the same location if you have a string of seven characters followed by a tab escape sequence. This makes tab escape sequences more noticeable when they occur further from the next tab stop location.

To make the whitespace more noticeable between the first two columns, add another \t after the two shorter student names as follows:


Console.WriteLine("Student\t\tGrade\n");
Console.WriteLine("Sophia:\t\t" + sophiaScore + "\tA");
Console.WriteLine("Nicolas:\t" + nicolasScore + "\tB");
Console.WriteLine("Zahirah:\t" + zahirahScore + "\tB");
Console.WriteLine("Jeong:\t\t" + jeongScore + "\tA");
